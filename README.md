# Inspiration

The app is inspired by our own goals to diversify our interests and become well-rounded individuals at university. We want to counter typical personalization algorithms that push us into bubbles and prevent us from leaving our comfort zone. Our algorithm is designed around the idea of filling gaps in the user's current profiles and encouraging them to try new things.

# What it does

The application gamifies the process of trying new activities and becoming a well-rounded individual. The app starts with the users taking a quiz about their personality and current interests, which establishes a baseline. Based on this, the user is recommended activities that they can "swipe" on to make us aware of their preferences. When a user swipes right on an activity, they can then choose to start logging hours and can then earn badges, and start streaks, which incentivizes sticking to the activity for longer times. As the user spends more time swiping, and more time actually doing activities, the recommender system's recommendations become more tailored to their specific profile.

# How we built it

The app submitted is a proof of concept. We have implemented a simplistic recommendation algorithm and personality quiz metric calculator backend in Python. We aim to implement the actual app using a Flask web-app. Right now, we have created mockups of the visuals using figma, and implementations of the algorithms.
